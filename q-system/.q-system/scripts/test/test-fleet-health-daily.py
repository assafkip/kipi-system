"""Pairs with fleet-health-daily.py.

The contract under test is the founder's rule, 2026-07-26: "detection without a
path to action is useless... the system should learn." A detector that only alerts
has moved the work back onto the founder. Prose cannot hold that line, so the
registry validator does — and this file is what proves the validator refuses.

Also guards the false-positive case that was live on day one: matching cron
scripts by BASENAME flagged 3 jobs when only 1 was a real duplicate. Linear issues
cannot be deleted here, so a false positive is a permanent one.
