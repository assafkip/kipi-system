# Reproducer + acceptance criteria for the review severity floor (ASK-113).
#
# THE DEFECT: the adversarial reviewer had no severity floor -- REQUEST CHANGES
# fired the same on 3 minors as on 1 blocker, and a Netflix-3am bar ALWAYS finds
# something, so nothing could ever reach APPROVE. The gate was unsatisfiable by
# construction (observed: PR #11 rounds 1-2, findings converging 2->1 blockers,
# verdict pinned at REQUEST CHANGES).
#
# THE FIX under test (pr-verdict-lib.sh + its two consumers):
#   - blockers/majors  => REQUEST CHANGES/BLOCK  => rework_gate exit 0 (rework)
#   - minors/nits only => APPROVE WITH NITS      => rework_gate exit 10 (stop;
#     minors are CAPTURED as spillover, not wedged into the PR)
#   - no verdict       => rework_gate exit 20 (no spec to rework against)
#
# THE FIXTURE RULE (test-linear-claim.sh scar): review-text fixtures below are
# VERBATIM slices of the real PR #11 round-1/round-2 reviews on this machine
# (~/.config/kipi/pr-reviews/pr-11-20260726-2033*.md / -2124*.md). The round-2
# slice already earned its keep: its "Fix first: **BLOCKER 1**" line after the
# verdict made a bare BLOCK token match report verdict BLOCK -- a live bug in
# the pre-lib extraction, fixed by the BLOCKER strip in extract_verdict.
# The APPROVE WITH NITS fixture CANNOT be a captured payload yet: no reviewer
# has ever emitted one (that is the defect). It is built to the exact format
# the reviewer prompt now specifies; parser and prompt change in one commit,
# and capture is soft by design (an LLM that drifts from the format yields
# zero captured minors and a logged zero, never an invented finding).
#
# Isolation: everything runs in a mktemp dir; never touches the live
# ~/.config/kipi/pr-reviews or the spillover ledger.

## VERDICT: REQUEST CHANGES

Fix first: **BLOCKER 1**. Add state to the update path so a rewrite reopens a closed rollup issue, or open a fresh issue when the tracked one is closed. Until then, the first time the operator does the right thing and closes ASK-90x, this detector is permanently silent on the board while Slack keeps saying the board has it. That is worse than the pre-PR behavior, which at least never claimed to have surfaced anything.

MAJOR 2 and 3 are the same root cause as the defect the PR was reworked to fix, one layer out: the fix landed on the detector and not on the report. Worth closing in the same change.

## VERDICT: **REQUEST CHANGES**

**Fix first: finding #1.** Delete the unguarded flag-adjacency clause at `fleet-health-daily.py:290-291`, or gate it to tokens that are actually in command position within their segment.

Findings #2 and #3 are also blocker-class before this reaches the fleet: #2 makes the detector go permanently blind after its first hit, and #3 publishes credentials to an object that cannot be deleted. #1 is first only because it fires most often.

Attacks that would BLOCK a lesser change all failed against this one.

## VERDICT: APPROVE WITH NITS

The single most important thing: none blocking.

FINDINGS:
minor|log line says "captured" before the write is fsynced|scripts/foo.sh:42
minor|help text omits the --issue flag|scripts/foo.sh:9
nit|two-space indent drifts to tab once|scripts/foo.sh:88
END FINDINGS
