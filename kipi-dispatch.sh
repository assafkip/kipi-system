# The heartbeat that keeps the Linear loop running with NO terminal open.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# Every converge run before 2026-07-28 was typed by a human into an interactive
# session. `kipi work` and `converge` had no scheduler, unlike every other kipi
# job. So the loop only ran while someone watched it, which is not autonomy --
# it is a person standing in for a cron job. The founder's requirement, verbatim:
# "I want to make sure that I can actually, at the end of this session, close
# this terminal."
#
# Lives at REPO ROOT, not under q-system/. Instance automation inside the synced
# subtree gets deleted by `kipi update`'s rsync --delete (RULE-2026-06-30-A, and
# the scar: income scanners went dark for 6 days that way).
#
# LOOP EXITS (loop-exits.md -- an autonomous loop owns 2, 4, 7 at minimum)
#   2 turn cap      MAX_CONCURRENT live converge runs, counted from the process
#                   table, not from a state file that can lie.
#   3 budget        one dispatch per heartbeat. The interval IS the rate limit.
#   4 wall clock    each converge carries --max-rounds; the reviewer is bounded
#                   at 2400s inside pr-review-agent.sh.
#   5 no progress   an issue moves to In Progress the moment the worker takes
#                   it, and ready() only returns backlog/unstarted -- so a
#                   dispatched issue excludes itself from the next heartbeat.
#   7 error thresh  the worker's own MAX_ATTEMPTS marks an issue stuck and
#                   stops picking it. This script does not second-guess that.
#   6 human interrupt  launchctl unload. Outside the loop, as it must be.
#
# WHAT PICKS THE WORK
# -------------------
# `kipi work` in DRY mode. Deliberately not a second Linear query: ready() lives
# in linear-worker.sh:197 (owner:sana, not owner:assaf, backlog/unstarted, has a
# DoR) and two readers of "ready" with drifting semantics is the exact defect
# class this repo keeps finding. One source of truth, asked politely.

# reached, nothing ready), and a skip is still proof of life. Recording the beat
# only on a dispatch would make a healthy-but-idle loop look dead, and would fire
# a false "resumed" ping on the next dispatch.

# --- DAILY BUDGET (loop-exits.md exit 3) ---------------------------------
# The concurrency cap bounds how many run AT ONCE. It does NOT bound how many
# run IN A DAY -- at ~1 issue/hour that is ~24 issues and ~144 `claude -p`
# sessions overnight, against a subscription with a real weekly ceiling.
# Measured 2026-07-28: one interactive night spawned 89 sessions and 44 reviewer
# runs. An unbounded heartbeat is a runaway-bill loop, which is exactly the
# thing loop-exits.md says an autonomous loop must not be.
#
# One issue costs up to MAX_ROUNDS x (1 agent + 1 reviewer) sessions, so at the
# current cap of 4 that is 8, and DAILY_MAX is roughly "sessions per day / 8".
#
# The two dials move TOGETHER. Raising the round cap without lowering DAILY_MAX
# raises the bill; the plist sets 4 rounds x 3 issues to hold it flat at 24.
DAILY_MAX="${KIPI_DISPATCH_DAILY_MAX:-4}"
# The budget day starts at RESET_HOUR LOCAL, not at midnight and not at UTC.
# Founder-set 2026-07-28, and the reasoning is safety, not tidiness:
#
#   UTC midnight     rolls at 17:00 local -- refills at teatime, leaving the loop
#                    idle through the whole working day it was meant to serve.
#   local midnight   refills the instant the founder falls asleep, handing a full
#                    budget to an unattended overnight run. Worst of the three.
#   local 07:00      overnight can only spend what is LEFT from yesterday, and a
#                    fresh budget arrives when someone is awake to watch it.
#
# Implemented by shifting the clock back RESET_HOUR hours and taking that date,
# so 03:00 Tuesday still belongs to Monday's budget. The file NAME carries the
# label, so the rollover needs no timer, no cron entry and no state machine: a
# new budget day is simply a new filename that reads 0.

# Belt and braces against the race between dispatch and the In Progress

# literal `b`, so this guard has never fired on macOS -- the only platform it
# runs on. It was harmless while every dispatched child was being reaped
# instantly; the moment children survive (the fix below), it becomes reachable
# and lets a second converge start on an issue that already has one. Same
# `ps -Ao args=` form and same [c] self-match guard as the liveness check.
# NO PIPE INTO grep -q, and that is the whole point (PR #39 review r3,
# finding 1). `ps ... | grep -q` under `set -o pipefail` fires only sometimes:
# grep -q exits the instant it matches, ps then takes SIGPIPE and dies 141, and
# pipefail makes 141 the status of the whole pipeline -- so the `if` does NOT
# run its body. Whether ps has finished writing before grep leaves is a race,
# so the guard worked load-dependently, which is worse than never working
# because it looks fine when you test it by hand.
#
# A snapshot into a variable plus bash's own =~ removes the pipeline entirely,
# so there is nothing to SIGPIPE and nothing for pipefail to poison. It also
# removes the need for the [c] self-match trick: with no grep process there is
# no grep command line in the table to match.
