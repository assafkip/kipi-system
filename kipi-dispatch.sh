# The heartbeat that keeps the Linear loop running with NO terminal open.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# Every converge run before 2026-07-28 was typed by a human into an interactive
# session. `kipi work` and `converge` had no scheduler, unlike every other kipi
# job. So the loop only ran while someone watched it, which is not autonomy --
# it is a person standing in for a cron job. The founder's requirement, verbatim:
# "I want to make sure that I can actually, at the end of this session, close
# this terminal."
#
# Lives at REPO ROOT, not under q-system/. Instance automation inside the synced
# subtree gets deleted by `kipi update`'s rsync --delete (RULE-2026-06-30-A, and
# the scar: income scanners went dark for 6 days that way).
#
# LOOP EXITS (loop-exits.md -- an autonomous loop owns 2, 4, 7 at minimum)
#   2 turn cap      MAX_CONCURRENT live converge runs, counted from the process
#                   table, not from a state file that can lie.
#   3 budget        one dispatch per heartbeat. The interval IS the rate limit.
#   4 wall clock    each converge carries --max-rounds; the reviewer is bounded
#                   at 2400s inside pr-review-agent.sh.
#   5 no progress   an issue moves to In Progress the moment the worker takes
#                   it, and ready() only returns backlog/unstarted -- so a
#                   dispatched issue excludes itself from the next heartbeat.
#   7 error thresh  the worker's own MAX_ATTEMPTS marks an issue stuck and
#                   stops picking it. This script does not second-guess that.
#   6 human interrupt  launchctl unload. Outside the loop, as it must be.
#
# WHAT PICKS THE WORK
# -------------------
# `kipi work` in DRY mode. Deliberately not a second Linear query: ready() lives
# in linear-worker.sh:197 (owner:sana, not owner:assaf, backlog/unstarted, has a
# DoR) and two readers of "ready" with drifting semantics is the exact defect
# class this repo keeps finding. One source of truth, asked politely.
