#!/usr/bin/env bash
# The heartbeat that keeps the Linear loop running with NO terminal open.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# Every converge run before 2026-07-28 was typed by a human into an interactive
# session. `kipi work` and `converge` had no scheduler, unlike every other kipi
# job. So the loop only ran while someone watched it, which is not autonomy --
# it is a person standing in for a cron job. The founder's requirement, verbatim:
# "I want to make sure that I can actually, at the end of this session, close
# this terminal."
#
# Lives at REPO ROOT, not under q-system/. Instance automation inside the synced
# subtree gets deleted by `kipi update`'s rsync --delete (RULE-2026-06-30-A, and
# the scar: income scanners went dark for 6 days that way).
#
# LOOP EXITS (loop-exits.md -- an autonomous loop owns 2, 4, 7 at minimum)
#   2 turn cap      MAX_CONCURRENT live converge runs, counted from the process
#                   table, not from a state file that can lie.
#   3 budget        one dispatch per heartbeat. The interval IS the rate limit.
#   4 wall clock    each converge carries --max-rounds; the reviewer is bounded
#                   at 2400s inside pr-review-agent.sh.
#   5 no progress   an issue moves to In Progress the moment the worker takes
#                   it, and ready() only returns backlog/unstarted -- so a
#                   dispatched issue excludes itself from the next heartbeat.
#   7 error thresh  the worker's own MAX_ATTEMPTS marks an issue stuck and
#                   stops picking it. This script does not second-guess that.
#   6 human interrupt  launchctl unload. Outside the loop, as it must be.
#
# WHAT PICKS THE WORK
# -------------------
# `kipi work` in DRY mode. Deliberately not a second Linear query: ready() lives
# in linear-worker.sh:197 (owner:sana, not owner:assaf, backlog/unstarted, has a
# DoR) and two readers of "ready" with drifting semantics is the exact defect
# class this repo keeps finding. One source of truth, asked politely.

# --- STALE-CHECKOUT REFUSAL (sp-c775b116) --------------------------------
# The loop runs the founder's WORKING TREE, and nothing kept it in sync with
# main. There is no `git pull` anywhere in this script. Observed 2026-07-30:
# merging PR #34 left this checkout at 1597eaf, so the loop would have gone on
# running the old Claude-only reviewer indefinitely while main carried the codex
# gate. It was fixed by hand twice in one session, which means every future merge
# silently depended on someone remembering.
#
# A DETECTOR, NOT A PULL. Pulling under the founder mid-session is its own
# hazard -- it can yank a working tree out from under an interactive session
# (the parallel-session scar). So this refuses and pages instead, and the page
# carries the exact command.
#
# REFUSE, not warn. This loop MERGES ITS OWN PRs and has no accepted-change
# signal, so building on superseded code and auto-merging the result is worse
# than resting until someone fast-forwards. Same posture as the reviewer's
# commit status: absent is not approved, and unstated HOLDS.
#
# A FAILED LOOKUP MUST NOT WEDGE THE LOOP. Refusal needs a POSITIVE answer that
# we are behind; a network blip, an auth prompt or a missing remote logs and
# proceeds. Two different safe directions, deliberately: fail closed on
# staleness, fail open on not knowing.

# --- DAILY BUDGET (loop-exits.md exit 3) ---------------------------------
# The concurrency cap bounds how many run AT ONCE. It does NOT bound how many
# run IN A DAY -- at ~1 issue/hour that is ~24 issues and ~144 `claude -p`
# sessions overnight, against a subscription with a real weekly ceiling.
# Measured 2026-07-28: one interactive night spawned 89 sessions and 44 reviewer
# runs. An unbounded heartbeat is a runaway-bill loop, which is exactly the
# thing loop-exits.md says an autonomous loop must not be.
#
# One issue costs up to MAX_ROUNDS x (1 agent + 1 reviewer) sessions. Do NOT read
# that as a fixed 6: the code default is 3 rounds, but the LOADED plist sets
# KIPI_DISPATCH_ROUNDS=4, so the live cost is up to 8 sessions per issue. The
# older comment here hardcoded 6 and quietly understated the running job by a
# third. Compute it from MAX_ROUNDS, never from a remembered number.
#
# THIS IS NOT A MONEY DIAL (founder correction, 2026-07-29). It caps SESSIONS and
# BLAST RADIUS, not dollars: how many issues per day may enter a loop that merges
# its own PRs. Two ceilings now sit behind it, not one -- since ASK-221 each review
# round is a real codex run, so an issue also spends up to MAX_ROUNDS of a
# separate external quota that did not exist when this number was chosen.
#
# HELD AT 3 on 2026-07-30 (sana's call, the founder does not set this). Reasons,
# in order of weight:
#   1. Per-issue cost went UP since 3 was picked -- 4 rounds instead of 3, plus a
#      codex run per round -- while the number stayed put. Raising it now would
#      compound a cost increase that was never accounted for.
#   2. The loop self-merges and has NO accepted-change instrumentation. That is
#      loop-exits.md's own named blind spot. Raising throughput on a loop that
#      cannot measure whether its output is good buys more blast radius blind.
#   3. The loop is not clean on the first pass, and tonight is the evidence: codex
#      found two majors in PR #46, which was itself the fix for a codex minor. The
#      review rounds are load-bearing, so throughput is not the binding constraint.
#   4. What actually blocked progress was evidence, not rate: the review never
#      reached the PR (sp-48688b24) and the receipt was unreadable (sp-1d1ad606).
#      Raising the cap before those landed would only have produced more
#      invisible reviews. Revisit AFTER an accepted-change signal exists.
DAILY_MAX="${KIPI_DISPATCH_DAILY_MAX:-4}"
# The budget day starts at RESET_HOUR LOCAL, not at midnight and not at UTC.
# Founder-set 2026-07-28, and the reasoning is safety, not tidiness:
#
#   UTC midnight     rolls at 17:00 local -- refills at teatime, leaving the loop
#                    idle through the whole working day it was meant to serve.
#   local midnight   refills the instant the founder falls asleep, handing a full
#                    budget to an unattended overnight run. Worst of the three.
#   local 07:00      overnight can only spend what is LEFT from yesterday, and a
#                    fresh budget arrives when someone is awake to watch it.
#
# Implemented by shifting the clock back RESET_HOUR hours and taking that date,
# so 03:00 Tuesday still belongs to Monday's budget. The file NAME carries the
# label, so the rollover needs no timer, no cron entry and no state machine: a
# new budget day is simply a new filename that reads 0.
